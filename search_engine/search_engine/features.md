# Quick-Links Quill feature
[Inspired by Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill from Harry Potter, although I don't intend on launching a smear campaign against the Boy-Who-Lived anytime soon.] 
When a user searches for a particular topic, it would be handy to have a place to note down relevant links to reference or revisit in the future. This is why a Quick-Links pane which allows you to add links to it during a particular search session and gets refreshed after every session would be useful. While similar to bookmarks, a Quick-Links Quill would provide a more streamlined approach by allowing users to save multiple links under a single 'pin' and refer to it in the future.

# Text-to-Speech feature
Although this isn't completely new, most search engines don't have a text-to-speech feature for visually impaired users. This will allow them to hear the search results and improve accessibility.
