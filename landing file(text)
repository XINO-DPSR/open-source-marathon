TRACKING THE WEBSITES THEY VISIT
I think we should track what the clients are viewing on several shopping websites and compare them by an AI system at all the websites.
Then we can show it on our home screen that the particular is the item is the cheapest where.I think most web brosers already do it(tracking what cients are seeing at shoping webites) but the difference is they dont compare the item 
so i think that could stand out
