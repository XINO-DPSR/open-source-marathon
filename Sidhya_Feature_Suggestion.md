# Legitimacy Index

* The days of deepfakes and fake news are already here. Illegitimate websites that sell unofficial propaganda, fake news, scams, illegal data etc. along with unsafe websites will be given a lower legitimacy index.

* The safer and trusted websites will therefore have a higher legitimacy index.

* The user will have the option to sort the search results based on accuracy, low to high legitimacy, and high to low legitimacy.


### Hypothetical Scenarios

1) A news channel **"Roxx News"** which is known for spreading biased news will be given a low rating.
2) A not for profit education website **"Mah Man's Academy"** will be given a higher rating.
3) Social Media and meme websites will be given a moderate rating.
