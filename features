TRACKING THE WEBSITES THEY VISIT
I think we should track what the clients are viewing on several shopping websites and compare them by an AI system at all the websites.
Then we can show it on our home screen that the particular is the item is the cheapest where.I think most web brosers already do it(tracking what cients are seeing at shoping webites) but the difference is they dont compare the item 
so i think that could stand out.


What's New List
I think we hould view a what's new list straight at the homepage. We could track don the webites the client views and directly get what's new on our homepage from the websites.


Complete customization of the website
We could get a cutomization tool embedded in the website so the clients can change the bg of the engine(like dark mode but the colour could be any),change font,text colour or possibly anything even the style of the buttons.
